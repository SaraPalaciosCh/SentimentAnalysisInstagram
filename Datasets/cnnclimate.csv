CSZUfvmtBxG;18126161185233544;Climate changes are occurring in every region and globally, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. As the world’s latest and most rigorous scientific assessment of the physical basis of climate change, the report defines changes that are unprecedented in thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years. It emphasizes that there is still time to act, but it must happen immediately. Limiting climate change demands strong and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from human activities such as burning fossil fuels.;1628722850

2. Warming is far slower than predicted.
3. Climate policy relies on inadequate models.
4. CO2 is not a pollutant. It is a plant food that is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide.
5. Global warming has not increased natural disasters.
6. Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities. 
7. There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic.";1628754686

CQoSzVNraaH;17970314581387227;@xxtoxicbeansxx i guess people will but even that (eating meat) is not sustainable, especially to meet the demands of billions of people. Perhaps if people were like tribes who live within their means, lower population, hunted and gathered their own food, etc. But its definitely different from our modern world. Leather production is also not as environmentally friendly as most think. Apart from all the methane the cows release, water usage + the deforestation to make way for cattles, they go through so much chemical processing/tanning to make them wearable. There are leathers now being made from plants, although still not completely without PU, its a step in the right direction (ethically and possibly from a sustainable standpoint). But i guess truly the best way is buying second hand and reusing existing fur or leather! And I agree, real fur and leather makes me sad 😞.;1624917806

CFQBNRepNpK;17901545386529428;@t__simoneaux :: I must respectfully disagree with your opinion on Trump’s performance (I personally believe both parties are corrupt, mind you.) Opportunity Zones are a way to gentrify lower income neighbourhoods in turn forcing minorities into yet another “Black Flight.” The low unemployment rate is deceptive and due to forcing prisoners into working slave wage jobs (more jobs were actually sent overseas than were created during Trump’s presidency.) The prison reform is actually benefitting more cocaine users (predominantly white) and the Justice Department is actively pushing to send some of these same people back behind bars, and prevent others from reducing their sentences—which greatly limits who can benefit from the law that Trump has touted as one of his signature achievements. :: Of the $59.9B requested by the US Dept. of Education, only $640M is allotted to HBCUs collectively. The budget proposes $1.6 billion to be invested in programs which lead to students earning a license, credential or which promote continuing education for working adults outside of a four-year institution. This is harmful for HBCUs, many of which offer traditional degrees and training for professional licensure in fields like nursing, social work, computer science and other popular fields, but are not the short-term programs the Trump Administration is looking to bolster with federal funding going to community colleges, for-profit schools or corporations looking to create training hubs for workers. :: More undocumented immigrants were jailed during the Obama administration and the Swine Flu pandemic was handled in rapid succession.;1601039332

Apart from that, emissions from the developing world occur for producing items that are consumed in the developed world.

CEkIxNBFWWU;17869518247919884;"@aho.kovi sorry posted by accident. I think education is important here. Hypocritical yes if you are oblivious to the fact that you think you are making a change but drive everywhere in your personal car. There are obviously situations that cannot be avoided, for instance; driving to work. I think it's important to educate yourself about the impact of your choices on the environment and try to consiously make enviro-positive decisions. If I cannot avoid driving to work on my own, and neither can I car-pool, maybe I can walk everywhere on weekends when I'm not working, or take my bicycle. Or maybe only buy clothing items made from material that have lower CFs than other, for instance tencel or hemp over cotton.  Slowly but surely, at least in one area, am I and 5 million others, consciously contributing to a lesser need for cotton, and hopefully it all turns into a positive snowball.";1598935935

CEkIxNBFWWU;17975228440315514;@aho.kovi so basically this green movement is wrong just because YOU think it doesn’t help and that is hypocritical. Do you think people don’t do research of these things first? Haha it’s not just like hey let’s make clothes this way and tell people is green and they will help just so they buy it. We live in a capitalist society where consumerism is the thing that keeps it going, the only real way to make a real change is to stop over consuming Everything, and that won’t happen, so why not use that to the advantage of everyone and change the way things are made, if people are still gonna keep buying then find different ways, different materials, less harmful for everyone. Also people have to go places, and it’s bc of the corporations that people can’t afford cars that are greener, don’t blame the people for getting and or using what they afford. Blame the system. believe me a Poor person with a car produces less trash and less emissions than a rich person with a Tesla. So no most people are not hypocrites they just live in a society where apparently being green equals being rich, and that’s not the fault of the people again.;1598911597

For those who aren’t educated in ways they can combat climate change, maybe instead of stating what not to do, state what they could do instead. We have to be proactive, not retroactive. I’m not necessarily disagreeing with you that this clothing is the end all be all, but what I am saying is that it’s an idea that incites other ideas.;1598907543

CEkIxNBFWWU;17910338464483992;@aho.kovi dude doesn’t even matter, IT DOES NOT MATTER. If people want to do something and claim they’re helping does it matter? If they buy these clothes that’s already doing something, not because they will clean the air but because by making them they won’t keep polluting, when the clothes are tossed away they won’t be as harmful as regular clothes, so it doesn’t matter if people just buy them to pretend, they’re still buying them and that itself is better than keep buying regular clothes. And the fact that you’re here basically saying why to do something if you’re gonna do other things that are bad for the environment, is like saying why do you help people in this situation if there’s others as well dying. just let people help, do your part, be an example instead of spreading hate. Maybe those people driving 5 km to work are living on a no waste lifestyle, or buy only second hand clothes, or volunteer to pick up trash, or just don’t throw trash to the ground, try to not buy plastic products... people can’t just do everything right at once when we grew up in a society where they thought us to be unconscious about our actions and what those meant for the environment, we are learning and if you’re not gonna suggest a better idea, step aside.;1598909045

CDfJvgSIx5O;17852970545181804;Instead of the pits going to waste they are making clothes that can go on someones back. Better than going to a fast fashion store to get clothes. And chipotle has always been environmental aware. Take the packaging for example and no they aren’t completely vegan but Chipotles animals don’t grow up in mass production farms, they live happy lives until the end with small organic farmers. A problem i find is you all expect everyone to be perfect all the time. Being aggressive won’t make anyone want to be sustainable, vegan or take any steps. It’s easier to choose to not be sustainable at all and be in denial than to try to be progressive and get criticized anyways. You don’t have to be vegan to watch what you eat. You don’t have to be a zero waster to be more sustainable. Let’s encourage one another;1596594477

CAyGpPTFTHx;17842939646201538;The concept of “zero carbon footprint” does not exists in the context of manufactured goods - you produce CO2 when producing the materials, you produce CO2 when transporting the shoe to the consumer and you also produce CO2 when disposing of that shoe as it’s being driven to a landfill/elsewhere. Even if you plant i.e. 2 trees for every pair of manufactured shoes (or the equivalent of how much CO2 has been produced during the manufacturing process) that compensation will not happen instantly. The CO2 will enter the atmosphere anyway, and will be stuck there for the next 200 years.;1590838944

CAquE6OFKaD;17889161434552865;@jenblei Luxury fashion labels aren’t the ones who go against what you’d like to see. It’s mid-range and fast-fashion labels that use toxic materials and subject their employees (at all levels besides CEO) to abuse. Major reductions in operations like this one by Gucci set an important precedent for the rest of the industry. I see this as a dramatic change to the industry, worth applauding!;1590583142

갑자기 혼자인 것만 같은 날
어딜 가도 내 자리가 아닌 것만 같고
고갠 떨궈지는 날
그럴 때마다 내게
얼마나 내가 소중한지
말해주는 너의 그 한마디에
Everything's alright
초라한 nobody에서 다시 somebody
특별한 나로 변해
You make me feel special
세상이 아무리 날 주저앉혀도
아프고 아픈 말들이 날 찔러도
네가 있어 난 다시 웃어
That's what you do
Again I feel special
아무것도 아닌 존재 같다가도
사라져도 모를 사람 같다가도
날 부르는 네 목소리에
I feel loved, I feel so special
자꾸 숨고만 싶어서
마주 하기가 싫어서
모든 게 의미를 잃은 듯이
내가 의미를 잃은 듯이 가만히 주저앉아 있을 때
그때 내 앞에 나타난 너의
따뜻한 미소와 손길에 (hey)
Everything's alright
초라한 nobody에서 다시 somebody
특별한 나로 변해
You make me feel special
세상이 아무리 날 주저앉혀도 (앉혀도)
아프고 아픈 말들이 날 찔러도
네가 있어 난 다시 웃어

아무것도 아닌 존재 같다가도 (같다가도)
사라져도 모를 사람 같다가도
날 부르는 네 목소리에

Uh, you make everything alright
구름이 쫙 낀 햇살 한 줌 없는 날
네가 바로 나의 shining light
That's what you do
아무리 어두운 밤도 다시 낮
I owe it to you
Because you make me feel special
세상이 아무리 날 주저앉혀도 (앉혀도)
아프고 아픈 말들이 날 찔러도
네가 있어 난 다시 웃어

B8HTFVYFFwP;18022954345254159;@tarrafloressloan these fields are horrible. Yes, using recycled plastic is better than new plastic, but it’s not safe for kids or adults to breathe the fumes. The fields last about 10 years, then thousands of pounds of artificial turf are sent to hazardous waste sites (or supposed to, lots of companies just dump it wherever). Our school district is installing these in every single school (elementary, middle, and high school) and it’s horrible.;1580850401

But labelling this field as sustainable is questionable given that a natural grass field is far less carbon intensive than one made from recycled plastic! It will be interesting to see how durable the field is (extending product life-cycles are key to sustainable/circular future) and how it will be treated when it needs to be replaced.

@jaccobbernstein turf fields are using old tires, the turf fields company are being paid by dumpster to take these massive quantity of unwanted tires.
Synthetic turf fields are actually linked with early cancer for soccer player, more especially goalies 🤓 You can easily google it, even if the industry tries to discredit scientific studies by talking about a ""cancer hypothesis"". @cnnclimate  thanks but no thanks.";1580761551

Users return used cartridges in the supplied box with pre-paid postage to PlanetCare. We disassemble the cartridge and remove the filtering medium with the fibers. This is done in a controlled environment, ensuring that caught fibers do not pollute water or the environment.

At the moment, we are safely storing the used filtering mediums. When we have a sufficient quantity, they will be reused/recycled.

B43A7aYJDFs;17900512828401157;@eddienajera_  have talked to Jesus in person? Because if you’re taking the ‘sin’ stance, as far as I know of teaching, he loved everyone unconditionally regardless of their sins and even so who are you to pass judgement on another person? Youre just another human too. Every creature deserves to love and feel loved. No one is trying to convert you to their practices of love because the hate you’re expressing on the internet implies to me that they’d rather you stay away. These men are trying to protect a future for all of us including you, which is the purest kind of care. So leave them be and you still get to win.;1573844187

We demanded all those mass produced goods and then shipped our garbage and waste offseas to other countries and didn’t create our own efficient, recycling facilities to handle our waste. And we have a society where wasting resources and having excess materialism is encouraged.
