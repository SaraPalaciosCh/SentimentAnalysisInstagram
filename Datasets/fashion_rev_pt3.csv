CQJNysGBD5E;17910952804784066;Yes! So much distance has been placed between consumer and maker in the traditional fashion system that people often think our clothes are simply made by machines. Sewing takes a great amount of skill - our garment workers need to be recognized!;1623853762
CQJNysGBD5E;18163914718180381;Love this!

CP-rhRQBjde;17878057985469103;Child labour is not the problem. Many families encourage their children in taking early jobs to help, experience responsability. For them is custom and honor for their families. Is when they are enslaved when their communities suffer the most. Not patronizing, other cultures are for us still a shock. We are what anthropologist call ethnocentric and see the social environment through prejudices and pre conceptions of our own. What is tragic is not to see a child supporting their younger brothers and sisters but how occidental companies see an opportunity and take advantage of them. Who ever they are. We empathize, we are all human beings, same root.;1623430868

CP-rhRQBjde;18013922197313650;Thank you for highlighting this. It still shocks me to find child labour still exists, but I also think the ILO doesn't go far enough, permitting children as young as 14 to work in factories. It's a complex issue but policy still plays a role and many brands I've spoken to whose Codes of Conduct approve of workers aged 14 or 15 fall back on ILO guidelines to defend themselves. There's more work to be done...;1623509067
CP-rhRQBjde;17876403824436866;@leartisanescarfer At first I was going to disagree with you but you're right - the protections aren't in place to stop children from working. Nor the fair wages that enable only adults to work. Companies and countries policy makers are responsible.;1623509181

CP-rhRQBjde;17989128139343058;@besmacc yes, my friend. That is what I call making profit from the advantage of a cultural factor. economist, big investors and business companies have being taking this terrorist formula everywhere their nose gave them a clue they could. We know them, we have social science, anthropology, ethnographic work and grounded theorist. They are  people of the forests. Believers, human kindness. Their home the very same environment we burn and disrespect. When we reach their little people, we use all we get to know against them and they just believe we are their friends and allies. Is heartbreaking. Just do what you can and read about them. These are our cultures of resilience, forefathers, great spirits. In extinction. Urban legend. Get others to do what they can.

CPn0rKFBL67;18004948099324435;@onesta_style agree completely, the small and sustainable/ conscious businesses have already had to weather over a year of uncertainty and massive financial risk to continue to operate and importantly support their workers throughout the pandemic (and this continues in ALOT of countries) which the FF giants demonstrated they don't care about at all. Small brands also don't have a pot of wealth created from huge profit margins to fall back on and by basically asking people to boycott 3 months of buying new and  not talking about how it is possible to buy new consciously (of which there are loads of mega businesses such as yours being conscious and innovative throughout the entire supply chain) which is 25% of a brands potential income .... which then impacts the workers again as some brands will not survive OR have to reduce their operational overhead to survive this latest hit. @remakeourworld I genuinely believe that the message could be even more powerful if you demonstrated that there are options to shop new consciously.  It would show those that prefer to buy new (being realistic, everyone is on different steps with a more conscious lifestyle and some aren't into secondhand) that there are amazing brands and businesses to support that collectively propel the industry forwards to a better place 👏, you'd also be supporting workers  and business stability so they could build even more positive impact in the future!;1622729187

Our designer initiative @fashionopenstudio is dedicated to celebrating small brands, and we have some exciting new projects coming up that aim to support the small businesses who are changing fashion for the better.

CPn0rKFBL67;18089871934260566;@onesta_style totally agree. It's big fashion giants that are cuasing harm to people and planet - I understand that all clothing has some impact, but boycotting all clothing means small, ethical, business losing out, and therefore many of the skilled jobs and training that they provide.  Surely the aim is to encourage people to by much less, and buy much better? And to encourage people to look after and repair their garments because better quality clothing can be repaired time and time again?;1622704445

CPn0rKFBL67;17934870682550859;@sustainable_fashion - we are in the same boat as you! We love challenges that stops obsessive shopping or encourages people to consider where they shop. Sadly, NoToShopping for 90days, although it sounds great, could actually have the opposite effect and cause small businesses like ours that are doing the right things to close. We already struggle enough trying to encourage people to support sustainable labels, this initiative could put us out of business and in our case 12 people would be out of jobs. The result… leaving big fast fashion brands who are the root cause of these problems.;1622706485

CPn0rKFBL67;17873875541505984;@onesta_style 100% agree. From beginning of time mankind has purchased from others (whether it be a trade or for actual money). Purchasing new clothes is not in itself bad, so long as it doesn’t take advantage of others and cause unnecessary harm to planet, people and animals. Boycotting people and business who are trying to make a difference is not the answer! Being conscious about your purchases and intentional about who you support IS! I won't be doing the no new clothes challenge, but instead I will support the slow fashion movement of buying less but better.;1622706670
CPn0rKFBL67;17904025048939100;We are concerned about this also. We love the challenge of fashion detox but worry that boycotting all shopping for 90days will have the opposite effect on small ethical brands, tailors and seamstresses, and artisan producers. I think there is an alternative challenge. 90 days doesn’t sound like a long time, but its long enough to put a small company out of business, especially after covid.;1622706846

CPn0rKFBL67;17956874215446405;@onesta_style exactly my concern. It’s very tricky because we want to slow down consumption as much as possible as it does make sense from an environmental perspective but socially it could be detrimental to people who reply of this type of business to make a living.

CPn0rKFBL67;18154286128095435;This is a potentially controversial comment, however we fear this challenge risks perpetuating the issues with fast fashion, and the challenge should be No Fast Fashion. People who follow Fash_Rev and Remake are people who genuinely care about the societal, animal and environmental impact of fast fashion, and who might care enough to go out of their way to support small, artisan brands that are producing sustainably and ethically. These small brands (like ours) are creating jobs and finding innovative ways to upcycle materials and produce lower impact garments that last. We already struggle with our pricing - our costs are so much higher than the fast fashion brands we are competing against, because we produce here in Wales, pay real wages and use lower impact materials and trims – which are more expensive. We worry that a 90 day challenge like this could put small businesses like ours out of business. The people who definitely won’t be following this challenge are the people who have no awareness, or don’t care, and will continue to buy fast fashion everyday. Brands like us are offering consumers a better alternative, and by boycotting responsible brands like ours, it means leaving the fast-fashion giants for conquer the market once again.;1622655374

CPYCtALh4M5;17918559772687167;As textile artists we find the inclusion of the amazing people who transfer this cultural textile knowledge to us is not only incredibly rewarding for us but also directly honouring of them. They are also able to sustain their own practice in their own communities as the appreciation of what they do is also being lost in their own cultures. The honouring, respecting, inclusion and financially rewarding them appropriately benefits us all. Our work in Cambodia particularly showed us that artisans themselves need support to be acknowledged in their own countries amongst their own people, particularly the youth who can continue these textile arts.;1622162995

We would like to brands continue to be held accountable through legally binding mechanisms rather than voluntary initiatives to protect safety, however this is valuable insight, thank you.;1620814620
COu-iDEhzM7;18210303040073112;@prama999 we absolutely agree, ultimately we need government legislation - that is vital. However, in the meantime, brands must be held accountable for their supply chains, particularly as brands often choose suppliers based on loose legislation in producing countries. So they cannot be let off the hook for safety violations they profit from, and we must listen to the demands of workers for the progress of the Accord to be protected.;1620814870
COu-iDEhzM7;17922868558579372;@fash_rev sounds like we agree. My point is more that Bangladesh today  is not somewhere with loose legislation on building safety.

COiXj5DhJ3i;17970719656390669;I remember grabbing a tall stool and insisting it stay for a heavily pregnant machinist - who had requested a standing sewing machine for her ease to keep working but she needed to be able to take short rests whenever she felt the need. I remember checking toilets and having the padlocks taken off from the main door.  I remember finding little chairs under large machines and asking who was usually sitting on them collecting the cloth fibres that build up .  I remember waste dye water directly going into brooks and rivers , unrailed staircases commonplace and cardboard boxes piled up in doorways. I’ve asked for papers to prove ages . I saw workers collapsing in the heat at the machinery, on site doctors rushing to restart their hearts the sound of thumping their chest doesn’t leave me , and being ushered out of the factories or I’d delay my production and much more . I’d hoped a lot had changed since those days.;1620317343
COiXj5DhJ3i;17868836723384672;Low wages, unfair wages have always been an issue. Global brands have sucked out the blood and sweat from these hard workers. But the end consumers love to shop for cheap fashion / cheap textiles. It’s important that we educate the end customer about what’s really going on behind those factory doors. 🙏🏻 thank you @fash_rev for shedding light on these issues. Will always keep sharing with our community 🥰 hopefully ethical and sustainable businesses, organisations and individuals can help these workers and provide them with everything they deserve 💪🏻;1620317829

So happy that we could contribute to this blog. More power to you @fash_rev 💚 let’s keep talking about the important things 💚";1619732364
COQB-mKBQBQ;17925848704529733;we believe that transparency to the consumer is essential for fair and sustainable textile production. @knowyourstuff.official we've created a tool that provides easy access for the consumer;1619769376
COQB-mKBQBQ;17904193528810827;Great initiative!! I would say it is vital to create a sustainable link between these farmers to the garment producers and then to the end customers and deliver the benefits to these farmers rather than filling up the pockets of corporate houses;1619808646
COQB-mKBQBQ;17898381904950612;@eclairex_ check their sources on Uyghur slave labour, the information all comes out of right wing think tanks and  ngo's funded directly by the USA regime change arm of the CIA. Corporate media are complicit in the US trying to destabilize the area in the same way they do in South America, Middle East, the rest of Asia and Africa. It's all fabricated to destabilize, disenfranchise and then radicalize, accept it hasn't worked. The question everybody should be asking us since when has the USA and Australia genuinely cared about Muslim people when we bomb men women and children every other day of the week? The West is once again inflicting violence on more Muslim's by boycotting their primary income, atleast their nation's people will support them. Look into the lies.;1619825170
COQB-mKBQBQ;17871946820419586;It is not ground reality. Issue is of confidence and survival on the ground. When I asked why we are not growing cotton all said not possible no body do in the area. Farmer see in their near by areas and go for common sowed crop. I started in 5 bigha and with three water we could get good yield. Market rates also quite good compared to other traditional crop like ground but which require 10 water. Now due to my experiment more farmers will go for cotton as it consume less water, no serious plant diseases, good yield, less pesticides, reusable cotton plants, and many more. Farmer want someone to stand prove show get cash in hand and they do what is required.;1619920136

CONZZLnhU4m;17894637605014686;I would really like to hear you talking about the evidences provided by @brazilianbaroness regarding the fashion revolution movement in Brazil. As you can clearly see by all the facts she brought to your attention on her posts, there are a lot of brands using the cause for self promotion and even people who claim that are ambassadors of the movement doing the same. Being a such a big country with a certain international influence, I believe you should focus more energy towards finding out what's happening in Brazil and hearing the voice of a seamstress who knows what she's talking about.;1619622130

I avoid the dryer and I don't let my dark clothes dry in the sun to avoid sun bleaching. A good tip also is to look for a good tailor to fix what you can't/don't know how to, you'll be helping maintain a little local store and you'll be using your garments for a long time.

Also, I would like to pay full price as a consumer for lines that pay enough feed workers, let workers select from improved, well-planned housing instead of warehousing workers like cattle or prisoners, and let workers have or use the lines to make a garment, if you don’t decide you are all just working on your own terms for country and regional improvement.

So, the footprint is in most cases better than organic cotton. If Viscose/Modal is mixed with GOTS cotton it’s really good. BUT, always source from certified supppliers!!

I also stopped targeting the eco-ethical up-cycling community a long time ago, figured no point preaching to converted. I focus on the mainstream fashion crowd, mainstream media etc. Feel like this is the biggest challenge for us, and hardest conversations are with those who really do love their H&M, Zara, PLT hauls and use their social influence to promote excess consumption.

CN2vWIdB5RX;17882389430240940;@greencatholic generally, women tend to leave jobs either for marriage or when they have children they find it difficult to work. There are older women that work there but generally the turnover is such that once women leave, management prefers to recruit younger people which perpetuates a younger workforce. With younger workers, mills can often pay them less. Another factor is the nature of the work, its long hours on your feet all day doing shift work and many women say they want more flexibility, especially after starting families, they prefer tailoring or smaller home-based industry work where they can control their hours a bit more. Not to mention the lack of maternity leave or childcare support from the mills. Hope this helps!;1618939773

Here in the UK @organic_textile_company is one that I have used and would wholeheartedly recommend. A lot of shops also specialise in deadstock fabrics, and whilst not ethical per se they at least are already there, so to speak. Also it is worth considering the type of fibre you purchase in terms of its origin and environmental impact (man made or natural/ water/ dyes/ recyclable or not/ shedding micro plastics in the wash/...)

CNcORVNhySy;17923555675571521;We need transparency from fibre to fabric, all the way through production. It's impossible or virtually impossible to trace fabric all the way back. I mean, most fabric shops/haberdashers can't or won't tell you where the fabric is coming from.

Sometimes I can buy from local or vintage factories but their raw materials don’t know where they came from. I started in recent years to ask questions  and still haven’t heard a compelling answer.
