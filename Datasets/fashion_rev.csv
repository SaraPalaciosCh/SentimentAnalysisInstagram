There is currently an open letter written by Eco Age to the UK government asking for these filters to be mandatory. You can read the letter on @ecoage;1654680186
CegUkZ6MUMc;17907733091562230;@loopyewes :) Just for understanding :  you mean the production of synthetisch fibres is damaging weather the material theyre made of is naturally?.;1654681424
CegUkZ6MUMc;18000736171450569;Thank you for that great explanation!;1654681528
CegUkZ6MUMc;17924549747268221;@fash_revspain As Dr Tom Stanton describes in the article, natural fibres in garment production are reliant on intensive manufacturing and advanced chemical manipulation. While they are presumed to biodegrade, the extent to which they do has been contested by a handful of studies. When fibres have been found in environmental samples, natural textile fibres are often present in comparable concentrations to their plastic alternatives, and very little is known about their environmental impact. Therefore until they do biodegrade, natural fibres will present the same physical threat as plastic fibres.;1654681669
CegUkZ6MUMc;17928465884486791;@wallawalla.berlin Synthetic fibres are man made, plastic fibres based on fossil fuel extraction and can never be regenerative, only environmentally damaging. 100% cellulose based fibres which are man made but use natural fibres such as plant material or wood pulp have the potential to be better for the environment but are very resource intensive to process I believe. Anything that is mixed/blended with synthetic fibres - recycled or not is harmful to the environment. To me, the best fibres are 100% natural like wool, cotton and flax. BUT they need to be farmed without pesticides and synthetic fertilisers and kept clear of chemicals throughout their processing journey.;1654681983
CegUkZ6MUMc;17928543599185346;@fash_rev This result depends very much which country you are in. At least in Finland the water waste management facilities are able to remove appr.99% of all microplastics from the waste water befoe the water goes forward. So this kind of problem does not exist anymore in Finland. I see the need to have microplastic filters in household washing machines if countries don't have sufficient plans to filter out the microplastic in municipal water treatment facilities.;1654686417
CegUkZ6MUMc;18169169971226942;"@fash_rev Right, but natural fibre are only reliant of intensive manufacturing processes If we produce and consume them in a fast fashion way, there are anyway other alternatives to produce them. 
We can't  compare organic extensive chemical free production with intensive GMO chemically transformed ones, and we cannot compare sinthetic  fibres with natural ones without mentioning  that not all natural fibres are produced in the same way, if we want to help people to take better buying decisions.
I understand that what Dr Stanton do is a comparison between what he found out from the studied river but the way it is explained can lead the public to beleive that plastic fabrics are not a bad option afterall. Also, not taking into consideration the other ways of productions can makes easy for marketers to interpret this article  as a way to say that natural and syntetical fibres have a similar impact when while both have a negative impact, biodegradabily is an important  inflexion point.
Telling  that, ""Plastic-free fashion is not as clean or green as it seems"" is true and of course ""natural"" is not a synonym of ""good"" because the actual production process is incredibly intensive and damaging, it is just that an important part of the information is missing to help people to create a valid comparison about the impact of the different fibres. Not mentioning that information can lead non-profesional people to beleive that all the natural fibres impacts are as negative as sintetical ones, which is not the case.
I love the infographic, but i maybe missed  a little more information about it.";1654687841

CegUkZ6MUMc;18207733291198432;"@claireisabel_trademark  Research by Columbia University suggests that laundry washed with detergent produces, on average, 86 percent more microfibers than laundry washed with pure water. This is most likely due to the general mechanics of how detergent works — by loosening fabric’s fibers for ease of cleaning.

CcqKm9ngtKA;17960633185644117;We think that the biggest obstacle in purchasing slow fashion items is... PRICE 🤑 In order to make better decisions, people must be motivated. And when price is the biggest motivator, then the reward for purchasing slow fashion items - or better yet, not purchasing at all - should also be monetary.

Ccpx8vCMptX;17944161589938577;@drstacface our opinion is that Value is something you can place on an item individually. For example a jumper knitted by my mother has great sentimental value. Did I wear said jumper? No, so I decided to give it to a friend, passing the story on and it is now worn all the time. Value doesn't necessarily have to equate to $$$;1650675365
Ccpx8vCMptX;18166193425210901;I do agree to a certain extent. Basics, like underwear and basic tees etc, can still be produced on a big scale with sustainable material. Those are products we need a lot and throw out after plenty of wear…..;1650679226

I think it’s something really useful to do for brand new stuff because that’s always a really considered purchase and its useful to help people consider new items actual cost to you and the planet;1650758651

CcVRiF2g3Gp;17948770675742049;❤️❤️❤️ it frustrates me when people brag about getting a cheap piece of clothing that I know has not made without giving a living wage to the maker.;1649998612

CcVRiF2g3Gp;17917968278462240;So important to explain to people, if something is incredibly cheap =someone somewhere is being exploited😢 if something costs 10 dollars it will mean that the cost is around $1.50- including materials, shipping, packaging, PR, amenities, insurance etc etc, the labour force making the t-shirts will probably make at most .10c of that per t-shirt. Do the math how many would you have to make over 10 hours. If you finish one every 5 minutes in an hour you would make $1.20 😞;1650038701
CcVRiF2g3Gp;17955266431696354;Absolutely agree. However, exploitation can be very insidious and masked under “fairwashing”. There are so many brands that claim to be ethical yet there is no mention on their website or social media of how they support the people who make their products. In addition to “spending more mindfully”, we need to watch out for brands that mark up their price and sell under the tag line of “sustainable” and “ethical” and ask them to justify those claims.;1650038938

CcVRiF2g3Gp;17865990755701983;Ok yes but can we talk about how many fast fashion outlets have gone bankrupt in recent years because people are in fact buying less and the only reason many stores are still open and in business is the property management companies bailing them out to keep their failing malls open?? It’s all about land ownership, voting with our dollars will not save this planet. We need legislation now.;1650042118
CcVRiF2g3Gp;17926856291218457;"Yes! Thank you for keeping this conversation going year round! I used a pricing calculator recently, and a top I sell in my shop for $85 should actually be $200 to pay me adequately (to account for costs/materials, website fees, AND pay me for my time...this is the part I often leave out 🤦‍♀️).

CcF0xqwgvn6;17855488940732815;@renwillisart the way we are used to consuming fashion is unsustainable in every aspect but we can change it.

CcF0xqwgvn6;17955610987709351;@ethix.com.pt I worked in the supply chain after over 20 years on the brand side. Brands have to out-perform each and every quarterly and show more sales and bigger profits. I worry that we can’t change. That it will require something apocalyptic bad to force change. Even the pandemic only slowed it down for a second. And after the past 2 years, fashion is STILL getting faster and faster with brands like Shein and other hyper fast fashion brands winning more market share. I thought for sure we’d learn something after a global pandemic, but nothing changed.;1649449940
CcF0xqwgvn6;17957733283712803;@renwillisart I worry about it too. It is terrifying, I know. And Shein's profit just goes to show that Fashion Is Powerful. And so, we have to fight with that in mind and use the power of fashion to educate people and help them fall in love with the true meaning of it: self expression and individuality. A celebration. Fast fashion is still winning because they make people feel like they are missing something, that they have to buy something in order to be and belong. As soon as someone sees that, it all crumbles down and a person that once was addicted to fast fashion want to learn and be thoughtful about purchases. There is a huge movement. But mainstream media still don't show that to people and that is a big part of the problem...;1649451675

It survives by fabricating feelings of not liking what you own, that you are now ""out of fashion"", and need to have the thing that is ""in fashion"" now over and over. This used to be every season, then every month, now it's every week and every day, which has devalued fashion making exploitation of labor even more aggressive.  All this without any large scale recycling or repurposing of the waste, both, post-consumer and in the supply chain.

CbxSmzWqHsB;18120241993272055;"I believe we should prefer quality material clothing than fast trends, that doesn’t mean I’m against designers or their work.

Infact i’m kinda glad that they support local artisans and treat them well.

What I mean is a clothing which is made out of quality material will last longer and serve longer.

It supports local artisans and business.

But it also comes to the point that we have to acknowledge not all people can afford quality materials. 

And that’s where the vicious cycle kinda continues.
The factories making cheap clothing, polluting the environment with all the dyes and chemicals that are being used, issues of Over working hours and underpayment.

Recycling is being practiced, but if we look and acknowledge the bigger picture. It’s just not about brands and privileged people, it’s about the whole textile industry.

Trends and mass consumption and glamorised consumerism is being promoted and it’ll keep affecting the society.

It will ultimately boil down to developing some kind of regulations, an all aspect one with considerations to every level of societal & economic hierarchy.

Maybe Some kind of regulations & monitoring covering the textile consumption, From making normal everyday clothing to exclusive ones.

Sadly there are many factories which still engages in unethical practices.

People will still fall into this circle of malpractice because we fail to acknowledge the all aspects of the textile & garment industry.

We should not overshadow the small enterprises with the big ones or ignore it without a proper understanding about the roots cause, various contributing factors and the society.

If we keep doing that, our mistakes, it will always keep repeating itself and we will keep failing to achieve the desired sustainable goal.";1649183600

CbpkVs9KxmJ;17844849716755148;If you’re on a budget, start small with your sustainability purchases and buy secondhand garments! This is a great way to support small businesses, and reduce profits of big name brands with unethical business practices if you can’t afford a closet full of Fair Trade garments at the moment.;1648484085
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17938434490987266;Sustainable products are expensive, as they usually are limited in quantity and expensive to make. The higher the quantity, the lower the price. Furthermore, sustainable brands claim that they pay their manufacturers higher = fair prices. Consumers need to understand that. Hence LOTS of ppl won’t be able to buy sustainable products. Take your pick…..;1648485356
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17924623319272155;@georgiagrdn;1648486812
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17946513385863672;Garment workers around the world experience low wages and exploitation. Some ways to help are putting pressure on the brands to pay more, donating to funds, and most importantly questioning your role. By slowing down our fast fashion purchases, we can send a very strong signal that we are not going on as we have for the last 20 years.;1648487880
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17936031983053110;"@danuceramics this is what i've noticed too. I used to get angry when people told me that shopping at H&M and such is irresponsible, because I'm a broke bish and can't afford expensive clothes. Except during the pandemic I have bought 2 pairs of dungarees, and nothing else, because I was scared to go into crowded stores, and I haven't suffered at all. Turns out the problem isn't that I can't afford expensive clothes, the problem is that I was shopping not because I needed new clothes, but ""for fun"". Last year I took a textiles course focused on sustainability, and now I can't imagine shopping for ""fun"" because knowing the suffering I would cause isn't actually fun.";1648493892
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17987664826462431;@pchlbeatrice but how much clothes do we need? How many items of clothing does one personactually need to buy every year? I feel likeit's rarely mentioned that a large part of why people can't afford to buy sustainable clothes is because we've been told that we need to follow trends and buy lots of new outfits. Why does someone's fashion interest outweigh someone else's right to live? How many people is one willing to sacrifice to keep enjoying their hobby? May sound extreme but that's the reality of the damage fast fashionis doing.;1648494098

CbpkVs9KxmJ;17883246827584845;@pchlbeatrice After near 2 decades in the fashion industry and working on both on large and small brands. I'll confirm this is accurate. Loads of factors, but in the main the pricing works both ways. Consumers have to be willing to pay more to support local production even with brands taking bare minimum margins to just get out of start-up dept before going bust.;1648510441
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17973652624487850;👏👏👏;1648513177
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17932122806100035;Becoming a slow fashion consumer is well within everyone’s reach.  It’s really about breaking the mold of what we see fashion trends are now.  We need to accept that we can make more use with less.  And when less is too boring swapping is a great alternative.  We can be thrifty, stylish and responsible consumers 🌱;1648515762
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17870332361675008;Yes!!! 👏;1648519150
CbpkVs9KxmJ;18211068010125998;@brian_kutsch I agree, but since we’ve made China ‘our supplier’ in almost everything, it is difficult to rejuvenate local manufacturing.  I think, ‘the west’ got very cosy with this. Not many like to work monotonous factory work, when having degrees….;1648519457
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17915764637276718;@craftycatqueen I fully agree and this question should go to all those influenzas;1648519517
CbpkVs9KxmJ;18291568021011404;What I don’t understand is why garment workers are in a position to have to work in these conditions. What’s going on with their infrastructure that these companies are positioned to exploit them? There’s a bigger social issue here and I’m afraid fast fashion is just a symptom of a greater sickness. Sustainability feels like recycling, bandaid solutions that put the onus on consumers so we’re too distracted to treat the real cancer that is the trifecta of colonialism, capitalism, and corporate globalization.;1648530277
CbpkVs9KxmJ;18287229868016787;Hello everyone! I am a designer I dream of creating a company that one day will pay everyone in the supply chain fairly and livable wages. These won’t be jobs they have to do they’ll be careers they want to do 🥰 because we all love fashion and everyone involved in it should be treated with that love and appreciation.;1648533731
CbpkVs9KxmJ;17953987138647139;@pchlbeatrice Yes, many factors and prices are skyrocketing from suppliers and fuel surcharges right now which will hit shelves later. We’ll see what happens in future.;1648554914

CbKtWptsmqh;17926361399312982;I’ve always thought that tags should include a production year on them as well. That way you can trace how long an item has been in circulation.

CbKtWptsmqh;17949375289754659;@manuvanos it's 80% women though which is why we say it, their exploitation is allowed and compounded by their oppression under patriarchy. Its not to erase the men but to highlight that its mostly women.;1647606293
CbKtWptsmqh;18119787181278372;"@rachaelaeden I get that and know what you’re talking about, and you this was definately not intended to put men foward but to add something to your post and there are a lot more than 20% men. Maybe depending on the country you’re looking at but especially in sewing. 

My post wasn’t men vs women, they share the same issue and what that needs to be addressed but stating and posting only ‘women’ is just not accurate";1647606466

CbKtWptsmqh;18131817988252224;@peopleheartplanet I’d love to know more about what’s in my clothes and where it comes from. I’m definitely trying to be more conscious but not at the cost of an annoying book of tags on the garment. Ghost tags are always itchy and when you cut them that’s worse and I can’t wear the outfit at the end of it all. So much for trying to be less wasteful and more mindful.;1648322373
CbKtWptsmqh;17905088765429443;@raksharathnam totally get the frustration. The label should probably be made removable like the price tag. It’s great to hear you’re being conscious about what you buy.

CaZcm36KULd;17900178623459350;Absolutely relevant and valid concept. It is the need of the hour. As our civilization evolves, it is time we move towards sustainability in all aspects of our life. In my country India, we believe in cottage industry and organic handloom, although western and European influences are prominent, but still many of my country people believe in yogic organic spartan lifestyle.;1645793275
CaZcm36KULd;17883575393551954;Totally on point! Decentralisation of fashion is so crucial to maintain ecological balance. Using local indigenous fabrics should be encouraged world over.;1645794799
CaZcm36KULd;17921758850192291;Stop entirely* buying newly produced clothes. The fashion industry only recycles old ideas- so find and wear better quality old/vintage/used clothes. *If you must buy new, consume the best quality you can afford made from natural biodegradable fibers. If you’re a fashion designer, why do we need your products in the world? How are they innovative? If you want to make “cute looks” or “want to express myself”, please think again.;1645796669

CaCt6K7AhU1;17960577016527604;"Only problem that I’ve with these kinda posts is that you’re “preaching to the choir”.

To sharing these posts amongst people that already know better, already do better, already buy better etc…is not gonna initiate the change necessary.

This message has to reach the big majority, people that do not know or know but don’t care enough yet etc…’we’ don’t need to keep reminding ‘us’ since we’re all following some of the same profiles because we already are in this to help the change. But that change is going to have to come from all of those buying 60-100 pieces of clothing a year online at or in real life at Zara, H&M, Primark or ‘insert random fast fashion company name’

It involves a major mindset change in people that in general aren’t on the same page as us, might not get that ‘not having the means’ doesn’t necessarily have to mean you can’t do better or that buying better will last longer (money per wear is higher) etc etc. Is requires legislation, rules, involvement by the government etc in order to create that mindset change so that customers, not us but the other type, will start tot want en demand different and big companies will get either financial support in actually doing better or have to deal with negative financial consequences when keep doing what they’re doing now. 

Preaching to the choir always sounds great cause you always get an amen and applause from this who are already converted haha…that’s not important. 

I don’t have the key to this needed change but that is what we should focus on achieving.";1645080738

Most of the environmental and social damage in the industry happens on the production side which isn't mentioned in this post. Overproduction and manufacturing waste as well as strategies of dealing with extra stock are the areas where more focus and attention is needed. Furthermore, whilst they might say otherwise for PR reasons, most brands don't own their supply chain and would struggle to come forward with how ""sustainable"" they are and how much environmental damage they contribute to. I would reconsider how I define what ""sustainable fashion actually is"" because as you currently define it, it's misleading and isn't support by any actual data of proportional environmental and social damage.";1642437864

CYtzZTvqm_Q;17957661925569438;As with the fashion industry in general - physical or digital, there will be those who use technology for good and those who are only in it for profit. I find the generalisation that digital fashion will only be accessible to the 'elite' to be short sighted. The true digital fashion community is all about creative expression, collaboration and decentralisation from traditional business models and gives them access to the fashion industry which is often perceived as elitist and inaccessible - how often do you hear the words 'artisanal' and 'hand made' thrown around to justify an overly high price point and effectively exclude those who can't afford it. I do agree that many use digital fashion and development as a green washing marketing ploy, and that needs to be clear to future consumers. From a personal perspective, I've been a designer for 10 years and in this last year came to 3d fashion design, I now sample virtually before I cut/make anything, my materials and time are precious and these new tools have really benefited my design process. But as with any tool, with great power comes great responsibility.;1642324328

Until we can pay garment workers & eliminate environmental racism, the people who are making money on digital fashion can put the brakes on it & give the money to garment workers who are capable of actually creating these clothes.

CYtzZTvqm_Q;17979425047458326;At the moment the industry is purely focusing on these technologies from a marketing standpoint rather than production which is where the true impact of these technologies can make a difference. We’re focused on visualisation instead of actual virtualisation. The problems to be solved are within the fragmented supply chain instead of thinking how we can look cool. The metaverse and NFTs are really exciting, but it still doesn’t fix the fact we’re over producing and turning out bad design. No one wants to talk about supply chains.

I dont think the partnerships between social media and govt are a coincidence.

Its a way to get people to spend more money without worrying about the space things take up physically. A new medium of spending and ownership, kind of like how buying a luxe black tee from Balenciaga has perceived value even tho its the same as another black tee.

CYtzZTvqm_Q;18110865862272097;Digital fashion may be the answer to the issues of fashion but it’s no answer to the issues of providing the planet’s population with the clothes it needs. Digital fashion is only relevant as a toy or as a way to feed the crazy culture of single-use and showing of that has been created. But actually - those very aspects of our culture are generating the problem and the solution should not be to feed them but rather to change them. Or at least to provide people with real sustainable clothing. To me it feels like creating more unnecessary objects (even digital „objects” use up resources) to solve the problem of the excessive amount of unnecessary objects. Doesn’t make sense to me in any way other that art 🤷‍♀️;1642196439
CYtzZTvqm_Q;18277441762063507;The thing has it germination during pandemia, as many people spend a lot more time on virtual and social media ( from games, to apps and social media) . The carbon print of virtual clothing is really less, it depends on the amount of quantity made of garments to amortizr it! But if it is seen as a one of a kind piece, it will not be so carbon free! It is creating now, so is the moment to decide how it will work. The most democratic the acces is the less carbon will be made, at the same time as people stay in virtual platforms it can reduces and help the enviroment to recover, but it has to ensure the people a good experience worth it!  The idea is to decrease consumption, and I think it might help it, but we need to control in order not to be made for cosume a different kind of product, as it will be the same with different taste. Is a matter of approach to the functioning of the metaverse.... as being *virtual* there are no rules yet, but we had to start thinking the boundaries and limits of this platform;1642196577

CXObX3lo6Bk;17893235528402140;@pool.berlin Over the years of our research, many brands who do not disclose their supply chains often say that it's a business secret they won't share for competitive reasons. However, not a single brand that has disclosed their supply chain has ever reported losing a supplier to a competitor as a result of being transparent – in fact quite the opposite, brands that do publish their suppliers have mostly reported how it's helped them in many ways such as collaborating with other brands sourcing in the same factories to make improvements!;1638983330
CXObX3lo6Bk;17871457769621247;@my_libelulle Great question! This is why our research purposefully targets bigger brands and retailers who have the leverage and resources to make change - we appreciate it can be much harder for smaller brands and wholesalers too, who often do comparatively more relative to their size and influence. Suppliers, agents and wholesalers often genuinely fear that revealing their supply chains and subcontractors will mean brands go directly to these businesses themselves and suppliers will lose the business, as you say. Suppliers and agents may withhold information as they do not trust brands due to imbalanced power relationships between buyers and suppliers. Therefore, there needs to be more trust and respect for the suppliers who are vulnerable in the current top-down transactional relationship they almost always have with fashion brands. It's about rebalancing that wealth and power with fair purchasing practices. Hope that helps!;1638983642
CXObX3lo6Bk;17922929825045280;This is so important and we totally agree. That’s why we’re transparent about every step of our production process and are proud to be #consciouslycrafted in North America. 🙌;1638987087
CXObX3lo6Bk;17883955922507232;@fash_rev right …thanks for sharing your research! ✨;1638991933
CXObX3lo6Bk;17928417880904557;@fash_rev This is just an excuse. If a brand says it must be disclosed otherwise we can’t do business, then it will be disclosed. There is nothing to stop big brands signing contracts that work in the favour of the supplier and big brands make more than enough to be able to invest, as well as spend at every step of the production process. In fact, the first brand who does this will you it as a marketing strategy. Unfortunately lots of these companies are plantations when you take into account how they are run. Some of them can make small allowances, but not realistic or meaningful change. They’re bad boyfriends that we need to get rid of. It’s like having a boyfriend who says he’s going to change, or going to leave his wife.  At some point a lot of the companies are going to have to lose and completely restructure from the ground up. Some big names will go bust. At the moment the fashion activists are encouraged by the rhetoric and token gestures of these brands. There has to be a cut off point though. Just like the plantations there were slave owners who wanted to continue, who promised to treat their slaves well. A bad tooth must be pulled, it can’t just be left to rot forever. I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again- we need a “ Fashion is dead, long live fashion “ moment. I will always LOVE fashion, it’s integral to the development of our culture and human consciousness. Fashion is a human right- but not when it’s at the expense of others. When it exploits others it becomes a tool of control for the masses. There are so many beautiful new, ethical and sustainable designers and brands popping up. Like beautiful abolitionists boats. It’s those people we need to get behind, so that we’re saving lives and the integrity of fashion continues to be preserved. The principle of fashion is freedom always and for everyone.;1638997399

CXIyBrEIG3_;18091728286304484;@loopyewes Great question! I do not. At this point, the best I've been able to do (as the seamstress) is trace back my materials to cotton and fabric production here in the United States to know that US fair labor laws are being implemented and workers are being treated well. Those who grow in the US are more likely doing so willingly and believe in the cause.

CXIyBrEIG3_;17939596444698878;"@loopyewes as far as percentage of my own products, I'm guessing their farm operations are way bigger than my little shop; so the price the farmers agree upon to the fabric Mills who knot or weave the fabric into textile will be pretty agreeable here in the US. The Mills themselves probably make the majority of the profit since small shops then buy the textile per yard, and our return on each good is quite low for the yardage and time/skill we need to create the garment. We're able to produce a very small number of completed garments daily whereas the textile milling is operated a lot by machinery and is therefore much more lucrative. 💚 We hang in there, though, because we believe in the cause and power of slow fashion + art of creating by hand";1638903017

CWu7kpFoGhy;17888762459522481;@i_will_die_an_artist I had a client say this same thing to me during our fitting at my boutique. She’s seems so over and done with the idea of not repeating clothes. And being that I am an alteration specialist I encouraged her to simple mend and tweak her old garments for more wearability. #sustainablefashion;1637931565
CWu7kpFoGhy;17909389544224492;@ragtimetextiles I completely agree to this. This is essential for mass production.;1637931598
CWu7kpFoGhy;17870468981571318;I still hold a lot of anger from my retail work days so it stresses me out to think about all the retail workers working the sales. If you’re shopping in-person remember to do so with grace and that there is always always a human being on the receiving end 💜;1637933250
CWu7kpFoGhy;17941239112680533;Also small business and sustainable store made discounts. I shop only what I need or meaningful Xmas presents. I don’t think that Black Friday is an initiative to demonize, like a lot of other things the goal is think before shop and give money to company and initiatives that generate value for people and the environment.;1637934569
CWu7kpFoGhy;17922363574989733;No. Planning to buy nothing but food today. I already have all gifts anyway, i collect them all year long, mostly flea markets finds etc. I bought a few expensive electronics on black Fridays in a bast few years just because i can't afford it otherwise. But don't seem to need anything like that this year;1637935284

CWu7kpFoGhy;18266787805014146;I don’t understand the argument that it’s some peoples “chance” to get good deals when it’s been proven over and over that Black Friday isn’t the best sales. Wouldn’t it be just as easy waiting for another sale as it is to wait for Black Friday? What essentials are on sale on Black Friday?? It’s participation for participations sake EAPECIALLY with the small brands that say their against it and have every ever ability in the world to save the sale until next week, but don’t.;1637936025
CWu7kpFoGhy;17928710326804911;I have shopped, for wools to make my own clothes 😊;1637937208
CWu7kpFoGhy;18028038163324791;Yes but so far it has been digital dressmaking patterns and buying a nice plastic free refillable mascara. Have been very good not to buy fabric but it’s been hard!!;1637937341
CWu7kpFoGhy;17903475929228222;"@kimberlyg.artistry agreed, a LOT of things that are actually on sale on Black Friday were also on sale for summer, fall, christmas, and any other midyear sales. Not to mention that a lot of the ""bare necessities"" people talk about aren't usually the items on sale anyway unless it's a store wide sale.";1637937459
CWu7kpFoGhy;17930136883777729;@olaide__sanni I see. The Reel culture is contributing then. Kudos to you for recommending her mend and tweak! I also see now how business owners can make impacts by saying no!;1637939357
CWu7kpFoGhy;18134703157244776;I use Black Friday to buy things (esp luxury items) I wouldn't be able to afford at other times of year, and to save money on things I need. We are a single income home with a lot of bills, and I wouldn't be able to afford cruelty-free clean skin products otherwise.;1637939443

CWu7kpFoGhy;17920658768065354;I shop Black Friday/Small Business Saturday deals for the small businesses I follow, but avoid large retail like the plague today and on most other days honestly- I love supporting independent creators and am actively moving towards an all me-made, thrifted, or small creator based wardrobe. I've been trying to move towards more sustainable shopping practices over the last few years, and have never really been into consumer culture- it just bothers me.;1637944570

CWu7kpFoGhy;17951765536567944;Not shopping, haven’t for years just to rebel against this concept. I do like the point you mentioned on affordability as thats very true for many of us. #greenfriday;1637949462
CWu7kpFoGhy;18018453505344058;I did shop a few items that I’ve been needing because they’re on sale but I’m not over shopping unnecessary items;1637952006
CWu7kpFoGhy;18028725091323921;I understand the issues with black Friday in terms of overconsumption, but I think there are ways to shop mindfully during the sales- only purchase what you need, and be aware of the sourcing you’re buying into. Are the items made in sweatshops? Are the items sustainable materials? Are these items I really need right now? Will I want this item in 6 months or a year from now?;1637954275

Lucy and Yak aren't discounting but instead are doing a charity initiative to send girls to school, which sits much better with me than discounting stock.

CWu7kpFoGhy;17899507667307417;For me its my time to get good quality basics like underwear and skin care, and any tech stuff we have broken like we’ve needed a new blender for months. Its the getting taken in by sales for things that dont need thats the problem, but its also when a lot if otherwise unaffordable brands like sustainable ones become more affordable;1637918401
CWu7kpFoGhy;17929268491800960;I shop Vintage, Sustainable and small businesses with or without a Black Friday sales 🖤;1637918937
CWu7kpFoGhy;17912929187060642;Shop from small businesses! Buying from them, even during sale seasons, goes a long way to help them to grow and stay in business!;1637919552
CWu7kpFoGhy;17931556966846628;Interested to read all the responses! ❤️;1637919555
CWu7kpFoGhy;17928967558795956;I've purchased a winter coat that I have been wanting for about 12 months now, reduced by 20% from £150. This is my first new purchase in about 9 months since shopping only second hand. It's going to be a coat for life and I've been thinking about it for a long time.;1637921033
CWu7kpFoGhy;17956056133531888;A lot through social media and influencer culture. The Reel culture where people want to be in front of the camera all the time, there is a subtle need to not repeat clothes. I wonder how of that fuels the impulsive buying.;1637921302
CWu7kpFoGhy;17912501609074169;We can shop more mindfully by buying good quality items that will last longer and sustainably sourced, although realistically not everyone can afford to do this, but you can find these items second hand. Most importantly we should be looking at changing our mindset in how garments can be worn, accessorised, reimagined and mended. Be open to wearing the same garment many times in different ways. Learn how to mend, find someone to help you mend if it's completely out of your skillset.  Invest in paying someone to mend rather than just discarding and buying something new. Be open to visible mending and be proud of the clothes you own. Not buying is not enough, we need to make our garments last.;1637921765
CWu7kpFoGhy;17903125973240531;No;1637922026
CWu7kpFoGhy;18193541881127264;I think it really gets down to consumption. Be mindfull, think 10 times before you buy something, buy more ethical and sustainable and never believe a fast fashion brand and its “eco-friendly” bull$€!T;1637922230
CWu7kpFoGhy;17856190784657538;@ragtimetextiles I also very importantly forgot to add, that we need to very consciously buy ethically. It cuts down choice massively, but really makes us think carefully about how garments are made and what exploitation happens in production. Even clothing discarded in charity shops doesn't have a happy ending. Think,  Research, Ask questions and Change!;1637922377
CWu7kpFoGhy;17962337074475347;Buying sales is ok as long as it’s needed and sustainable items! Don’t buy because it’s on sales that’s overconsumption…;1637922696

Focusing on the environmental damaging practices of the fashion industry in Ghana. Particularly by charity shops who ship unwanted donations offshore and now this. 

Chile is where I am from, the Atacama desert is and should be protected as is the rest of the world, from fast fashion and it’s overproduction of junk. 

What can we do? I feel we are drowning and no end in sight? Why are governments not legislating against overproduction, the use of toxic chemicals and protecting the people who make the clothes?

CWDXsezgotN;17873334572603636;True sustainability is to wear what’s already in your closet or be willing to invest in more expensive and durable clothes. There is no way to deliver the above requirements without someone, somewhere coming to harm.;1636456249
CWDXsezgotN;17906470520128719;I think is easier in ideals to say we want to pay for sustainability ( or rather the actual true price of clothes) than when it comes to paying for it;1636456988
CWDXsezgotN;18028980136320900;Definitely find that customers care less about sustainability than price - blame stagnant wages, economic precarity and big brands undercutting ethical practises in every conceivable way;1636456990
CWDXsezgotN;17854297967656102;Unfortunately over production and low prices by big brands has made the problem worse. Although sustainability is spoken of more, social media and consumerism makes it difficult to choose sustainability over price reduction or cheap clothing.;1636457822
CWDXsezgotN;17890636520516055;So useful to have these stats! It’s interesting too to consider how what we think we want / look for compares with our actual purchasing habits.;1636458346
CWDXsezgotN;17888445353431989;Thank you for sharing this  survey. Very insightful ❤️;1636459150
CWDXsezgotN;17920144885999778;Interesting. Why are we always looking for a bargain? 🤔;1636459739
CWDXsezgotN;17845088546673078;I was wondering what the percentage is of people looking at recyclability of their purchase. So likeliness of it being recycled after use. Because @africa.collect.textiles has to deal with it at some point…;1636459816
CWDXsezgotN;17897615294306021;Same story with food. People say they want to buy organic, ethical, fair trade, in reality most go with the cheapest option. 😢 And I feel this is going to get worse in the coming years as prices rise across the board and people will have less disposable income.;1636462872
CWDXsezgotN;18011115478356466;Action point: declare all prices discount prices. Ta-da! Now consumers can make decisions based on other reasons.;1636463663
CWDXsezgotN;17848570205658561;👏👏👏;1636465136
CWDXsezgotN;17994039943388594;I want socially responsible clothing. Like actual fair wages and conditions. I also want environmentally-friendly clothes, but I have SUCH a hard time finding things that are actually trustworthily made fairly.;1636467214
CWDXsezgotN;18180787330156683;"if the consumer is not being paid a ‘fair’ wage either, it’s hard for them to spend the ‘extra’ money on ‘fair wage, sustainably made’ clothing, or any product for that matter. the percentage of consumers who can truly afford to make decisions based on these factors (organic, fair trade, recycled materials etc.) is probably a lot lower than we think. 

If I spend $128 on an organic cotton top from @mate_the_label, then I can’t afford to go out with friends that week, because it cuts into my entertainment budget. but if I spend $58-$68 on a polyester blouse (that I want to assume is ethically made in a factory overseas, because who’s to say every single item made in China is unethically produced?) then I can afford dinner with my friends. Why would I (or the average consumer) give that up? 

also - my Mate The Label organic cotton top gets holes in in quicker, because that’s the nature of the fabric. that’s just how it wears over time.  but my polyester blouse lasts longer, because that’s what synthetic materials were made to do - last! that’s why we can’t get them out of our landfills. but I can’t continuously spend more on ‘ethically & sustainably made’ clothing, for them not to hold up and then I have to repurchase. 

I’m all for the idea of sustainable and ethical production, just like the next person. but I hope that sheds a little light on many people’s realities.";1636469494
CWDXsezgotN;17923569991847840;@augustmoon.co however very much agree that overproduction is a huge problem - I truly feel there is a middle ground / sweet spot that is achievable in the industry.;1636469612
CWDXsezgotN;18035366578309463;Of course they want to purchase it at a discount price. Inflation, job losses because of COVID and companies not paying they’re employees proper wages to match the market are some reasons. I’m not surprised 😂;1636469932
CWDXsezgotN;18112777786261104;Sad isn’t it- we want cheap food and cheap clothes ☹️ not realising the true cost of those decisions.;1636471199
CWDXsezgotN;17954923270539367;@sophie_avalon well said 👏;1636474498
CWDXsezgotN;17887089155465140;This is insightful and yet sad! Unfortunately, unless consumers demand better and are not brought in by unverifiable sustainability claims and low costs nothing is going change.;1636474582

CWDXsezgotN;17896539362388855;"that's true for a lot of people, but most of us consume way too much too.

CWDXsezgotN;17896052189410020;@augustmoon.co maybe the answer here is to consume less? Is it really reasonable to destroy the environment and the lives of other people (because aside from the borderline slave labour usually involved in fast fashion production, the production and treatment of polyester can lead to both environmental and health damage for the people working there), because want to go out with friends?;1636524190
CWDXsezgotN;17859782798616484;Completely agree 👏 The sheer amount of clothing produced (which is ironic due the lack of transparency to truly measure this industry)  means we need to shift our habits. Very wary of green washing.;1636528221
CWDXsezgotN;17948219140580173;I tend to go for second hand first as it is both cheaper and better for the planet 💚 Also if bought from charity shops it helps make money for a good cause.

CWDXsezgotN;17910125789300021;@sophie_avalon 👏 Absolutely agree - the system is rigged in a way that makes stats like this unsurprising.;1636532023
CWDXsezgotN;17919093637908651;@christinetobiasz_ Absolutely! What this survey really shows is that the consumer is pressured to be responsible for buying our way to sustainability, while brands continue to push unsustainable products at an unsustainable rate. Not surprising at all!;1636532152
CWDXsezgotN;18199510963185787;@augustmoon.co Thank you so much for sharing this perspective!

CWDXsezgotN;17937605296685816;@sophie_avalon a fair bit of vanity and possible addiction, self worth in the mix and the social media lovelies that help along the way.  I see another 50yrs easy coz to be honest, most do not care about anything wider than themselves,  the post is showing the trend. Companies are bound by profit and the appeasement of their customers.;1636575826
CWDXsezgotN;17937083953691406;@jenibatey definitely think it's the companies driving the want. And people so want to care, they've just got lots on their plates / heaps of collective trauma to heal! We can get there.;1636576130
CWDXsezgotN;17916516722091723;"that’s so upsetting!! i see it all around me … and i always tell people about the MANY negative effects of “fast fashion,” but most prioritise price. i can’t do it. i literally own 2 pairs of jeans and about 3 pairs of different pants … and they have all lasted me 15+ years. to me, paying $150 for a pair of jeans that will last decades AND is kind to people and the environment is much more important than having 10 different pairs for $15 each that wear out in a year. *”$150?!? that’s a joke!” i hear people saying. buy out-of-season; RESEARCH before you buy, and check sales - it can be done!! everything that i do not purchase NEW has either been a gift - something i wouldn’t buy for ethical / environmental issues - or purchased secondhand. i even buy ethical socks! and same applies - i don’t care if my socks cost $20; i only get a few and i know that cost isn’t being put on people WITHOUT the choice or on the planet. i always say (regarding many things!), if you are so PRIVILEGED that you CAN make the choice, make the “right” one!!*";1636587330

CVvq_B4ICaO;17918349257053420;@pchlbeatrice We support legislation that mandates greater transparency and accountability, like the mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence law in the EU. Transparency across the supply chain is fundamental for a fairer fashion industry and voluntary brand sustainability initiatives are not sufficient for big systemic change. Ultimately brands have the responsibility to implement these changes as they have the influence and resources and power over purchasing practices. Hope that helps!;1635946682

CVvq_B4ICaO;17902959566184609;@fash_rev I agree and thank you!unfortunately, brands are too slow and usually not willing to adjust their pricing. Hence the burden lies again on the manufacturer. It would be great, if the brand honchos might resist buying more houses or yachts with their annual (well deserved 😳???) bonuses and pay workers a humane wage and increase costs for their products to be more sustainable, instead.;1636040776

CVkg2t_omLz;18026960467318917;Living in a country which has gone through a very rough economical patch, I have been thought from an early age to save and reuse. Of course, in my twenties that seemed like a very lame approach. Entering my thirties and seeing the impacts we have on our surroundings I’ve learned to embrace the “save and reuse” mantra. However, I do it my way - I invest in pieces I like and bring me joy, this way I know I will reuse them for years to come. I no longer buy plastic decoration and rely on natural or more eco friendly alternatives like clay, wood, dried flowers, fancy bottles. I hang cookies and use rechargeable batteries for all my fairy lights. My costumes come from thrift stores or I rely on make up. I stay away from glitter even though I love it :( My downfall is candles, as soy/bio alternatives are more expensive and don’t come in a huge variety here. 🤷🏽‍♀️;1635422464

CVLBpqToGEp;17905957112316721;I think the idea of inclusivity is great. But imho the issue is the same as with sizing or being made sustainable, the burden suddenly falls onto the whole industry to include everyone which is nice but from business point is utopic. I prefer the approach of the brands that take the issue at hand and create purely based on one problem. You want sustainably made fashion - here’s this brand. You want fashion who cater for disability here’s this brand. You want cheaper and faster fashion here’s this brand. And then consumers have options. And industry matures. But to simply ask a fast fashion business to do what a slow business can only achieve is not productive to the solution. And consumers don’t always want the same thing so their needs gotta be met too. Just saying to take more business level approach rather than finger pointing at who did wrong;1634569956

CVLBpqToGEp;17893877105508326;@roberta__kai the point is to focus on universal designs. To invite everyone is impossibly, just get a plus size and a purple with dwarfism. The main idea is that brands would have at least something or start to think about universal solutions. Most of the time the “adaptation” is simple to be implement. It’s more a decision, e have different ways we can start being inclusive.;1634626871
