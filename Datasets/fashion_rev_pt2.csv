CU7lvMKIDl6;17895004214300476;Thankyou for this post. I have been trying to understand how sustainable or unsustainable cotton production is and what I have found out is that it varies depending on the region and making a blanket statement on cotton as unsustainable is extremely unfair to small cotton farmers. Cotton production in some parts of India definitely has a problem and I am hoping small land owner farmers can be educated and empowered to trace their roots back to sustainable methods of farming. I think BCI does that if I am not wrong.;1634111313
CU7lvMKIDl6;17884777574454023;@curobe.co Absolutely.. I have been saying this about the cotton statistic for years now. This is a very nuanced topic. It depends on the region, rainfall in that region and many other factors.;1634111450

CU7lvMKIDl6;17895747491286071;We read the entire report and as a Masters graduate from London College of Fashion we’d like to say there are many factors and elements which this report has not taken into account. First this report does a really good explanation of what misinformation is and how it works. In a similar way this report is structured to give a one perspective opinion. Second, the myth 1 - it takes 20k ltrs to produce 1kg cotton + mixed with the claim it takes 20k ltrs water to make one tshirt, they themselves in the report said depending upon the region it may take over 7k ltrs of water to produce 1kg cotton, this is where their myth busting ends, whereas they overlooked the manufacturing process of making yarn and then the tshirt. So their report is incomplete in their own way. Second myth they busted was cotton is a water thirsty crop, but they didn’t present any comparison, which is where the word ‘thirsty’ plays in. Cotton does take more water than linen. Fashion being the worlds second most polluting industry definitely debatable.;1634159695

CUXtvOJIZ9B;17906274476169542;@pchlbeatrice According to @theorispresent, under colonial rule, Ghanaians were expected to conform to professional dress codes as defined by the British. In order to enter certain rooms, to get certain jobs, attend certain schools or to be considered a ‘modern global citizen’, Ghanaians had to forgo their local dress in favour of Western clothing, swapping out sustainably made kente for a shirt and tie. Colonialism created the conditions for conformity. Navigating oppressive colonial rules is a survival mechanism, not an expression of demand. Colonisers profited from those rules by selling hand-me-downs and importing used clothing. This evolved into the secondhand trade we know today.

CUCyZT9oSR5;17969034292448566;Yes, yes, yes! I’ve really limited my second-hand clothing purchases exactly because of this. Too much fast fashion. Not enough quality.

CUCyZT9oSR5;17892372149295741;"@endtimesmagazine I'd say it's both. Fast fashion production is extremely harmful for the environment in several ways, so ending fast fashion would be a massive improvement. Generally speaking, fast fashion can only exist on the basis of exploiting workers, and it's not a coincidence that fashion production has been moved to less privileged countries, where workers have little to no option other than working in extremely harmful environments. On the other side of the spectrum, it's also a question of who needs access to fast fashion. None of us should ""need"" it, but whenever fast fashion is brought up, people say they can't afford anything of better quality, because it's too expensive. So on both sides of the industry, people are being underpaid and hence have to rely on either the production or the consumption of fast fashion. It's a wheel that will not stop turning until it is broken.";1632151070
CUCyZT9oSR5;17942171140587663;Agree with all this but it's more of an issue with capitalism that you are just describing in the narrative of brands and fashion. This sadly happens in all industry with growth at all costs;1632153045

CUCyZT9oSR5;18176649898151415;"Reading your 2️⃣ paragraph for the fourth time, trying to make sense of what exactly it is you're saying, but there is still something KEY that is missing... Are you saying that it is the brand's fault for being so successful in selling low quality garments to the majority of the population who cannot actually afford, (or are not privy to affordable) higher quality garments? Also, are you saying that this is the reason why foreign fast fashion companies are becoming more prevalent—because of their success in marketing to lower income and to the less informed? Honestly, no one ever desires low quality anything. That is why there is MORE to be said other than the brands' savvy ways. And that is to the choices many actually even have. It's a MUCH more multifaceted than just these kinds of brands successfully selling their garbage to us. At its core, I think many of us will agree that is a MAJOR social issue, at its peak. Even as we attack it from this fashion side of things, (while firmly building the new paradigms based on the ways of our Indigenous peoples), it's really more about our choices and even MORE, what is available to us. If garbage is the only thing available and / or affordable, because of the socio-economic failures that many societies have been built on, held up by systemic discrimination against the Indigenous, black, brown, people of colour, immigrants and others considered minorities ... then we have to look at it from that point of view. That is the core of our issues in the fashion industry, and until that is directly addressed, or ethical fashion / sustainable design is made affordable, accessible, and available to ALL, then a continuous flow of ""garbage"" is what can be expected. 🌿a.c.";1632171475

Cotton production requires a lot of water, energy, labor, pesticides, and insecticides. Recycled cotton, however, demands much fewer resources to manufacture than conventional or organic cotton. 

It minimizes the environmental impact of cotton production drastically. Recycling one ton of cotton can save up to 765 cubic meters of water.

Cotton recycling is an ecological textile production method. It conserves resources, reduces waste, and doesn't involve harmful substances. The process significantly saves water, energy, and carbon dioxide emissions. The regenerated material is also natural, bio-based, biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable

We have found though that we struggle to get people excited about recycled cotton. So many brands claim to make products made from recycled cotton but the reality is that their products only contain a small percentage of the material. As a very small brand we can’t compete with others that make these claims.";1631803708

CTmtEMho8Eh;17910950318046739;@madela1ne we don’t think there’s a problem with people making money. Our point with this post is A) it’s not possible to keep clothing out of landfill without investment (time, money and labor) so no one should donate under the assumption that it’s not a business. B) We want people to recognize the hard work going into the secondhand economy (everywhere — including in the Global North). If people recognize that it’s a business and a supply chain then they will hopefully do research and ensure that they give their clothing to companies that pay a living wage to their employees and who make sure that the work is safe. C) the profits could be more evenly distributed across the supply chain / across regions.;1631219365
CTmtEMho8Eh;17891120417295074;"That’s one of the reasons I love what I do, which is to help market second hand clothing to those who might otherwise not be interested in buying used.

I also love to remind others that thrifting and second hand is an option, and to thrift whenever possible! Love the message here, especially with large corporations who market themselves as charity or recycling but actually are not keeping most of the clothing. 

While I’m here, I have a question on a similar topic but slightly different. I’ve been mulling over a question and would be curious on your (@fash_rev ) thoughts about this: is it better to throw away the existing clothing made from older fabrics that might not be as eco friendly in the wash cycle, or better to reuse/up cycle it so it doesn’t end up in a landfill?

May I share my point of view? First of all we are totally agree to this! In detail of our plan that we are combining partly chivalry spirit so we called chiv(chivalry + pia(utopia) = chivpia. 
Our concept is to take our product margin to brought back our products and to make it in recycle product/given it to poverty community/or reselling for local citizen. So we have a slogan""Give it a second life"" mean to give you clothing a second life and do not waste it! 
Me and my wife has planning this for a long time. It is need to have enough profit margin to do this so we try to target leisure class. Actually we don't know if it is correct or not but at least we can do some change from small part in community.

CTUhZqvInGm;17929621108726299;Now, I do think it’s a problem when skinny or average-sized upcyclers create designs using themselves as the fit model and then just hope that their potential customers are the same size. That’s why made to order is incredibly important (but also very challenging because of the nature of remaking existing garments: How can you sell a design if it only exists as an idea in your head?);1630619187
CTUhZqvInGm;18144821368172033;@lucypreiss but it’s all already waste! Why are we discussing the potential for saving some of the waste for other people when there’s way more than can ever be used up by upcyling shoppers?;1630621695
CTUhZqvInGm;17971702459430071;@anniedleinahaystack I totally agree.  We are missing an outstanding platform to connect the right people with the right product.  Sites like EBay, Poshmark, ThredUP are still so cumbersome to use.;1630622885

CTUhZqvInGm;17955549184491336;Those upcycling videos are a bit problematic sometimes imo. Most times people don't know how to properly sew or finish pieces and they end up ruining them without realizing. These pieces might look kind of ok the first time you wear them, but they won't even survive a wash and they'll end up in the landfill anyways 😕;1630630639

CTUhZqvInGm;17926089205756519;"Just wanted to add, when buying from charity shops do try on different sizes and not just your own. Items of clothing have often been shrunk on the wrong wash, don’t assume something is too big for you, try it on. 
The world is awash with second hand clothes, in all sizes, charity shops, community centre shops, jumble sales, private clothing swaps, and such as eBay. Go for it!! 👗";1630653147
CTUhZqvInGm;17869370528560544;I love this! One of the most useful, sustainable and budget friendly things to know is a bit of basic sewing. I’m pretty short so hem alterations are my life and they make a huge difference!;1630655112
CTUhZqvInGm;17881242878417452;I have a pdf on my sewing website people can use to record the measurements of their clothes rather than their size. Coats, jackets, dresses etc different finished measurements. Then take a tape measure when shopping https://www.sew-it.biz/patterns/4595304237;1630655186
CTUhZqvInGm;17869454378561949;@janesideways Think you’ve hit the nail on the head, pricing in fast fashion stores is often on a par with prices in second hand stores, so the average consumer isn’t incentivised to buy second hand instead 😕;1630656774
CTUhZqvInGm;17923038940829150;I don’t really understand your point. What is the secondhand fashion sizing problem. Bigger sizes not being available? If yes I don’t think it’s the problem of the second hand market. The second hand market reflects the clothing sold in stores a few seasons prior. If bigger sizes are not sold in bigger numbers in the regular stores in the first place then how are they supposed to pop up on the second hand market later? If it’s a lack of standard sizing it’s not unique to the second hand market either, sizing is brand specific, it can even differ in different lines from the same brand. Sizing is so arbitrary and rarely carry any information, I’m of the firm believe that clothing should be listed by actual measurements.;1630658499

CTUhZqvInGm;17911913966008219;@magsascencao i mean i feel like it's the only way to learn though, being a seamstress is not something that comes naturally to most people. I'd still rather people practice and learn than not try at all 😊;1630660066
CTUhZqvInGm;17899420337278490;Definitely! Inconsistent sizing is a real problem and more so for secondhand clothing. This is why we do what we do at Easysize- help brands solve the sizing problem for their shoppers, focusing on their fit preferences rather than measurements. Our goal is to help reduce online returns for brands and avoid clothing waste.;1630662687
CTUhZqvInGm;17929095586696378;@craftycatqueen of course, but with any craft you need to have good sources first, you shouldn't rely solely in experimentation. My problem is with the people making these videos because they create misleading content. I don't think you should be showing someone how to do something that you don't know how to do yourself, you're teaching them how to ruin something instead of customizing it to last. I've seen a lot of these videos where people cut the fabric and don't even teach you to hem them or do a zig zag stitch on inside seams for them not to fray and that's the basics of sewing, you don't need to be a seamstress. And most times when you don't have a good source / teacher it's hard to figure out the mistakes you're making all by yourself.;1630663624
CTUhZqvInGm;17868180584576792;@gwenandwear many times those that are superior at this job have quit and moved on to greener pastures..I refuse to allow people to disrespect me and claim they can't pay more than $5 an hour for my work( and with self employment 20% is gone right off the top)..they argue about how long it actually takes to do a job when they clearly have never sewn themselves..and generally treat us like paying us is a burden..nope I quit even through a use to design and make clothes all day long and clear twenty to thirty on hour thirty years ago..many have went with other passions to pay the bills unfortunately..pay us our due and we would gladly go back to our first love..treat your sewing professionals they way you would want to be treated..done with the lecture..lol..all the love in the world!;1630663802
CTUhZqvInGm;17903768912140764;"@magsascencao i don't know if i agree tbh. Most crafts start with experimenting, even with good sources. Yes, wasting material is ""bad"" i suppose, but if you learn something from it I don't think it's wasted. Not EVERY single item you make is going to last a lifetime, and a lot of the material found in second hand shops is fast fashion, meaning the durability isn't there to begin with. Even qualified seamstresses make muslins, to perfect patterns and fits, it's part of the process. I don't think telling people they shouldn't do it at all is conductive, it will just gatekeep and make people fear it. It's better to practice and learn than relying on fast fashion for another 50 years, which for a lot of people are the only options. Failing is part of the process.";1630663907
CTUhZqvInGm;18250948579020379;@magsascencao each to their own though, I just don't agree :);1630663930
CTUhZqvInGm;18250099327041107;@craftycatqueen yea but I agree with you that you should experiment and make mistakes and try again, that was not the point I was trying to make;1630664090
CTUhZqvInGm;18092853616272164;@craftycatqueen I just don't agree with TEACHING / making video tutorials if you don't know how to do something. Like I can't fix a bathroom so I won't promote myself on tik tok fixing bathrooms because whoever sees that and tries to mimic what I'm doing will ruin their bathroom 😂 It's a silly example but I think you can understand what I'm trying to say;1630664213
CTUhZqvInGm;17908317842090069;@magsascencao yes, but youtube is one of the few free resources out there. If I've studied for years in my profession, I'm not likely to have time to spend the extensive hours to put up courses on youtube. I'd be more likely to turn to skillshare or similar services. But that means people have to pay for it, which not everyone can do. I just don't think it's that serious, there are thousands of painting tutorials from bad painters too, that's a, waste of resources too. It's what youtube is 🤷‍♀️;1630664643
CTUhZqvInGm;17912241868996950;@bellacherrine ok but when did I disrespect anyone? I am an artist and maker myself. I can see but not well, I know how much skill and time it takes to do alterations and respect those that do it well and PAY THEM ACCORDINGLY. I’ve been disappointed when I’ve paid upwards of £100 for alterations only to be given back a beloved item and have seems crooked or the work I requested just not done properly(asked to have an elastic waist shortened and instead had new band of elastic darted inside the existing waist)! If you know a good tailor or dressmaker in London I’d love a recommendation as I’ve got a STACK of beloved pieces I’d live altered but am unwilling to have them ruined by someone who doesn’t care about the quality of their work.;1630665347

CTUhZqvInGm;17853309746631650;@anniedleinahaystack came to say the same thing. Passing on items that are too large won’t actually mean they will be available to plus size people if they are discarded before they get to them.;1630672166

CTUhZqvInGm;17898430841246266;@lucypreiss To my knowledge, alterations are normally used to adjuct the fit, not change the size. At least not more than an inch or two, which does not significantly impact selection.;1630694773

CTUhZqvInGm;17858509742589268;I feel like second-hand shopping has gotten more expensive while the quality hasn’t increased. In fact, because of fast fashion, it’s harder to find quality pieces second-hand. Why would I pay $35 for something at Goodwill that costs $25 on clearance at the original store?

CTUhZqvInGm;17986466773380353;@lucypreiss Totally! We're certainly not advocating for trends in thrift flipping that see smaller sized people buying up the limited number of secondhand garms in larger sizes. Where we do think alterations can play a game-changing role in secondhand is when someone buys something secondhand online (think Depop / Thrift+ / Vinted / etc), and it doesn't quite fit right, yet there isn't the option to return the item as there would be when buying new ✨;1630589960
CTUhZqvInGm;17879917205451848;@lucypreiss agreed 100%. I have changed my habits and stopped buying things even one size up for myself to alter… I have more options than some people and so leave more on the racks than I used to.;1630590159

CTUhZqvInGm;17893520516220503;The tips for second hand buy remains same as fresh buy - choose well buy less. Just because it’s second hand- don’t add polyesters or fast fashion into your wardrobe it will eventually land up in landfills as attachment with those clothes will not go for long. We have to reduce consumption of not so environment friendly products and buy only sustainable products wherever applicable. Check your second hand products are clean and hygienic. Here also check who made my clothes. Decide forever we are not going wear pain, slavery or child labour even if it is second hand.;1630599866
CTUhZqvInGm;18175886470183703;The other thing I find with buying second hand off eBay, even looking at sizing charts on brands websites, is that clothing can shrink in the wash & now isn’t the same size, which can be frustrating 🧐;1630600616

CTUhZqvInGm;17933423038639490;@akalroop_taruna That’s an interesting perspective on boycotting labor practices even through secondhand clothes. If you’re buying your clothes from a for-profit store that pays people for their old clothing, then you could argue that the potential for resale encourages consumers to support unethical brands. However, if you buy your clothing at a not-for-profit thrift store where all the clothes are donated for free, then the feedback loop between secondhand purchasers, original purchasers, and brands is severed. And if buying a poorly made garment secondhand means that you don’t go buy a poorly made garment firsthand, then I think we should encourage it as a short-term solution to induce behavior change.;1630617544
CTUhZqvInGm;17915434354856294;I hear a lot of frustration about the lack of plus-size clothing in the secondhand market. The distribution of sizes in today’s used clothing landscape is going to look a lot like the new clothing landscape 10+ years ago, when it was even less inclusive than it is today. However, I don’t think you can put the blame for not being able to find things in larger sizes on the relatively small number of remakers who might be taking in larger garments to make smaller things. The blame for that lies squarely with the supply chains we have in place.;1630618315

CTUhZqvInGm;17906605466103328;Yes! There is definitely a sizing issue with secondhand clothing. It can be frustrating to have to alter/rework. And getting it altered takes time and raises the cost significantly. I’m glad more brands are being size inclusive now and hope to see more secondhand pieces in the future, but for now I guess it may be best to treat secondhand pieces as a creative project!;1630589065
CTUhZqvInGm;18026584585311502;Hi! I just wanted to point out that encouraging alteration can actually make secondhand clothing less size inclusive - as typically smaller people can buy larger sizes and take them in drastically, but it can be a lot harder to do it the other way. This can leave even less larger sizing available for those who may already be struggling to find their size. I’m definitely not saying to not alter secondhand clothes, but I think people might not realise what the impact could be when they do this!;1630589307
CTUhZqvInGm;17879766827448972;Dying is always a good option to refresh a color or change the style.

CTUhZqvInGm;17917516678900872;The issue I see is that so much of the stock available in thrift stores and op shops is that the quality isn’t there to begin with.

Do you know what s conditions for stamping made in where ever? When they asked me why my shoes are this price ? I replied because it s 100 % made in France. The leather is coming from tannery small family business. Skin are coming from local breeders where they care about animals beings.The skin I m using is natural vegetal tanned process. In every step of fabrication workers are paid accordingly to one  of the strongest work legislation in the world.

Kind of need to go back to 40’s style rationing for new clothes (with obvious exemptions for disabled people and groups who find it difficult to acquire second hand) and a package of support to phase out garment production in the countries that rely on it. 
And an end to polyester production on a global scale. 
Maybe you should start asking for that rather than asking companies what are in their clothes? If you ask for something radical maybe you’ll get half of what you ask for. If you ask for something small you get ignored.";1628688364

CSEvjYXIOPs;17877609485419853;A great topic for discussion, being a founder of a small sustainable brand, I completely agree that when you are small there is more control in the production cycles. However, I do also think that it's not only about the size of the company that makes a difference, there are a lot of other factors - for eg. as a brand are you willing to tell people that they will have to wait to get what they ordered, are you willing to forgo the sales that you might loose for not overstocking, are you willing to stand up and tell your customers that a part of your collection will be timeless so that it is not bound by seasonal changes. These things have to be in your DNA, regardless if the companies are big or small. I know some smaller companies that also have issues related to overproduction and wastage - so I think it's a combination of various factors that help fight the issue related to overproduction.;1627977684

Coraball collected micro plastics unfortunately DO just end up in a landfill or in the ocean with all the rest of our trash. A washing machine filter seems to help keep the micro plastics out of our public waterways only. However, they are working to find ways to recycle these materials, and it’s still worth getting one because while it does not help our oceans or waste issues, it at least lessens the amount of this stuff that gets into municipal waters while it’s on its way to the ocean.;1627315501

CRyexseDNFB;17920953838776666;"We NEED more and better data in the fashion industry. 

Tests to determine microfiber loss from washing synthetic clothing vary widely. Researchers use different textile products, parameters, equipment and do not always interpret and report the results in the same way. Results vary widely as a result. For example, the Ospar report reports a proportion of microplastic pollution from the textile industry of 1% and the IUCN 35% (Boucher & Friot 2017).

It is important that an unambiguous test method is developed to prevent these divergent results. There are currently several serious developments on this subject (like microplastic consortium). 

Governments should focus on 3rd party independent data, based on a systemic approach based method. Because only with correct data, we can find correct solutions to create a circular fashion industry. If not we are fooling ourselves.";1627450085

CRyexseDNFB;18170679499179474;"@fash_rev thank you. I looked over the studies, but they either have estimations or scenarios. So, the number you posted here are (one number you wrote wrong - must be 34,8%). 
Could you please share your source which numerically proves (no estimation) that fashion is the #1 source of microplastics in the ocean? And could you also share the ratio of single-use plastics in terms of microplastic pollution in the oceans?";1627476114
CRyexseDNFB;17855106428583476;@the_one_who_shouts Thanks for your comment. Like with all academic studies on ocean microplastics, these are based upon samples and informed estimates, due to the impossible nature of measuring entire oceans. In terms of single use plastics such as water bottles, these appear not to be a significant contributor to microplastic pollution specifically, however they do pose a threat in terms of general plastic pollution on land and at sea.;1627477257
CRyexseDNFB;17911351642850230;@fash_rev thank you, but not all academic studies are based on assumptions - saying this as an ex-academician. I would expect your platform to mention the numbers as “estimations” rather than the “facts”. It gives a wrong impression. Moreover, single use plastics have significant impact on the pollution. Please check academic articles for that, too. I cannot believe that fashion is the #1 contributor to that based on the facts. I invite you to re-look into this post.;1627486148

And that’s probably the truth , 😔. If there is transparency and green wassing isn’t possible any more brand will need to change if they don’t want to loose there customers.

There will always be  artisan work as that is a niche market and always will be. For those in need of clothing, not fashion, we need to ensure that charities providing that service continue to do so. Lockdown has limited access to charity shops and many in need do not use fashion resale sites. Plus size can and should be part of resale, but it needs those with the stock to put it out there. I am a larger older person who has bought second hand since the jumble sales of the 70's and continue to find gems online and in local second hand shops.

CQ01qEnhjxi;17953312801465632;While it's great to hear of the demise of fast fashion, I'm not sure 2nd hand shopping is so much better. A large percentage of items you find in thrift stores are in fact from fast fashion. It's a bit like freeganism or dumpster diving- you can only live off the excess if there is excess to begin with. If fast fashion dries up, I expect prices to rise and quantity of available options in 2nd hand stores to drop. I know many stores have other items as well but I think these two industries are much closer than anticipated.;1625490283

CQ01qEnhjxi;17882770640482831;@zeynep.atasoy.9 I had the same thought, the price of secondhand has increased so much that it's on par with fast fashion now. Shopping from places like Shein is officially the same cost as perusing Goodwill and Savers (in my area at least).

CQ01qEnhjxi;17864627867533932;"How does this affect those vulnerable artisans making a living out of their textile crafts? 

It sounds similar to what you read about lab diamonds and recycled gold. Sounds great on paper, makes people feel better about themselves but it actually cuts out from the solution those most vulnerable and who need help the most. The solution should be focused on, as you have said before, changing consumer behavior. Here is the latest article on the issue of recycled gold by JCK online. Not about fashion as such, but still related.

CQ01qEnhjxi;17884826186259282;On the one hand I love buying and selling secondhand and I do think it’s important to keep doing that. But right now I feel even the secondhand market is getting unhealthy. There are so so so much items for sale. Prices are ridiculously low. A dress that was new €180,- and is still in new condition you can only get €30,- on the secondhand market. And than you’re lucky because €22,50/€25,- is more likely. I feel sometimes people buy items, especially from fast fashion brands and when they buy it already think I will wear a few times and than resell or donate it. So it keeps the same unhealthy habits in place as before only in a less bad way for the environment. I think we still need to change our perspective when it comes to buying clothing. Buy items only when you “need” them and throughly love them and want to keep them for years and years to come. Than you only have a few items a year to resell. Still enough to keep a nice secondhand market but not as ridiculous as right now. And for now, the only thing to do is shop second hand so the new items bought in stores decline or from sustainable brands and even when you buy second hand buy smart and with care because those items still need packaging and shipping. And when an secondhand item comes in and it doesn’t fit, resell it again or ask a friend or someone in you’re family if they want it. please don’t trough it away. ❤️;1625249448

CQ01qEnhjxi;17924442619722202;I think we’re overlooking at a big fact right now. As much as second hand buying/thrifting sounds great it’s being more and more unavailable for the people that are in actual need of cheap clothings. They’re loosing their original purposes which was to provide the poor with basic clothings but bc of social media it’s exploited and the whole industry is treated as fast fashion industry now. I’ve seen many videos over the internet of people complaining how these thrift shops have lost their intentions and prices are unreachable for them. It’s almost as if brands are putting out even more products bc the retailers want to “thrift it” and gain income. So I don’t see a winning situation here unfortunately, maybe it’s just me idk 🤷🏻‍♀️ but I don’t see any positivity for these sectors except for decreasing over consumptions.;1625269644

CQ01qEnhjxi;17961976408414641;@zeynep.atasoy.9 absolutely!! It’s actually a real problem. I have noticed prices go up so much in second hand stores to the point that it is cheaper to purchase the same thing new from Kmart (very cheap Aussie department type store) they also charge more if it’s a “good” brand. @salvosstores is definitely going down this road and it is very sad to see. Charity shops should not become a cheap source of clothes for people who can afford to purchase from sustainable/ethical brands, leaving only the crappy stuff for people on low incomes.;1625280286

But the entire industry has a problem that goes beyond the fibers. If you’ve ever been to a factory, you’ll realize the vast amounts of single use plastics, polyester threads (even brands marketing their products as biodegradable quite often are using poly threads..), poly courier mailers, tags attached with plastic thread… and the list goes on and on.

It basically does not look good on anyone and it doesn’t last - it’s not clothing, but an illusion of clothing. Which makes it even more absurd that people have to suffer to produce it…
Unfortunately, a lot of consumers still have unrealistic expectations as to how long it takes to make a garment and what it should cost.";1625124437

CQbHmhIBvgt;17890279133136144;I personally don’t think it will change much. The root of the problem is in the nature of the fashion industry, where regularly things are out of fashion and you need the new pants that are completely different from the previous one. Regular people don’t stop using something because it needs repair, quite often they are perfect just not in fashion anymore. For me, I just stop wearing something if I don’t fit or if it’s beyond repair. On site repairing is a great service, but I doubt it will change anything numberwise - do you have a market research on this?;1624369001

CQbHmhIBvgt;17903041588929684;@pequenosescoceses I agree to your point. That fashion needs to renew itself is an intrinsic challenge about it. And it’s not even only about the industry. (Though it could slow down a bit :) For me it is a phenomenon that has its origin in humans being social and is not about fashion in clothing only but hits all consumption aspects in our life and even beyond those. I still believe that change is possible though, by small steps in consciousness in everyone of us and steps from the production side.;1624534688

CQOYbpZA70H;17861206016542018;It is sad that she origin of pollution, labor exploitation all across the production chain is caused by the big buyers, the brands and mainly the department stores.  In my county Ecuador, the major department stores do not have a policy for tracking this harmful  issues, they are only worried about keeping at the lowest possible the price that they pay to their suppliers.  Not minding that low prices means inevitably contamination and exploration actos the supply chain.  How great it would be if any major brand or department store would use as their competitive advantage the fact that they are very strict in controlling their supply chain, and letting this be known by their clientes.  I don’t understand why this is not happening. I am sure that young buyers would not mind paying a little  more money knowing that the garment they buy is eco friendly and protects adécuate labor conditions.;1623956166
